# 🛣️ Smart Road Crack Detection using Image Processing

A computer vision project that detects cracks in road surface images using **classical image processing techniques** — no deep learning required. Built with Python and OpenCV as a university course project.

## 📌 Problem Statement

India has one of the largest road networks in the world (~6.4 million km), yet a significant portion suffers from poor maintenance. Cracked roads lead to:

- **Accidents** — especially for two-wheelers and cyclists
- **Vehicle damage** — tyres, suspension, and alignment issues
- **Higher maintenance costs** for municipal bodies due to delayed repairs
- **Flooding** — cracks allow water seepage, weakening the road foundation

Manual inspection of roads is **slow, expensive, and inconsistent**. An automated image-based crack detection system can help municipal authorities quickly identify damaged sections and prioritise repairs.

## ✨ Features

| # | Feature | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Image Loading** | Load single image or batch-process an entire folder |
| 2 | **Grayscale Conversion** | Convert colour images to grayscale for processing |
| 3 | **Noise Removal** | Gaussian Blur to smooth out sensor noise |
| 4 | **Contrast Enhancement** | CLAHE for better crack visibility |
| 5 | **Edge Detection** | Canny Edge Detection to find crack boundaries |
| 6 | **Thresholding** | Adaptive thresholding for robust binarisation |
| 7 | **Morphological Ops** | Dilation, Erosion, Opening & Closing to clean results |
| 8 | **Contour Detection** | Identify and filter crack regions |
| 9 | **Crack Highlighting** | Draw detected cracks in red on the original image |
| 10 | **Severity Classification** | LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH based on crack area coverage |
| 11 | **Visual Pipeline** | Side-by-side display of all intermediate stages |

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/road-crack-detection.git
   cd road-crack-detection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # macOS / Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ▶️ How to Run

### Process all images in `data/` folder
```bash
python src/main.py
```

### Process a single image
```bash
python src/main.py data/sample1.jpg
```

### What happens when you run it

1. The system loads each image from `data/`
2. Applies the complete crack detection pipeline
3. Displays intermediate stages in a Matplotlib window
4. Saves all outputs (grayscale, edges, result, etc.) to the `outputs/` folder
5. Prints a **severity report** to the console

## 📊 Sample Output

### Console Output
```
==================================================
        CRACK DETECTION REPORT
==================================================
  Crack contours detected : 12
  Crack area coverage     : 3.45 %
  Severity level          : MEDIUM
==================================================
  → Moderate damage. Maintenance recommended.
==================================================
```

### Pipeline Stages

The system generates a side-by-side visualisation showing:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Original | Input road image |
| Grayscale | Converted to single channel |
| Blurred | After Gaussian noise removal |
| Canny Edges | Edge-detected binary image |
| Threshold | Adaptive thresholding result |
| Morphology | After morphological cleanup |
| Detected Cracks | Final result with cracks in red |

## 📈 Severity Classification

| Level | Crack Area | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 🟢 LOW | < 1% | Minor surface cracks, road is mostly safe |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | 1% – 5% | Moderate damage, maintenance recommended |
| 🔴 HIGH | > 5% | Severe cracking, immediate repair needed |

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Use deep learning (CNN) for more accurate crack detection
- Build a web interface for uploading images
- Add GPS tagging for mapping cracked road locations
- Real-time crack detection using drone/vehicle-mounted cameras
- Mobile app integration for citizen reporting
